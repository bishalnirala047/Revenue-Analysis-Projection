  There  are four CSV files .They are list of departments , total number of unique scheme codes , scheme code to department mapping and  the input data which is the dataset of revenue collected by the Government of Meghalaya for the last five years.
Dataset consists of Department names ,Scheme Codes , major heads ,minor heads,  sub minor , sub head ,scheme names , mapping of department  to scheme codes. Each Scheme code has 13 digits . Whose first four digits represents the major head . 
By combining major head, sub major head, minor head, sub minor  head  and  sub head scheme code is generated . Every department has itâ€™s major heads.
Some example of tax revenue majors heads are  Land Revenue, Taxes on Wealth etc.
  Each department has some major heads which are the first  four digits of scheme code.In the revenue collection dataset which is our main dataset every record of revenue collection is recorded by their scheme code,department is not mentioned in the record.
Therefore first I map the departments to their respective scheme codes and major heads using the reciept_dept_mapping file then only select the rows whose majorheads are less than 2000 or major heads less than 2000000000000 beacuase major heads whose value is 2000 or more than 2000 is not for any revenue collection it is only for transaction from one to department to another.
After that ,I analyzed the data and shown total revenue collection of each department and their major heads accordinfg to different years because each department has different major heads. In vizuallization I used pie charts and bar graphs.After that I applied average, mean and percentage increament formula to predict future revenue collection of each department
"This is Meghalaya Government's finance data that is why I am sharing the dataset here"
